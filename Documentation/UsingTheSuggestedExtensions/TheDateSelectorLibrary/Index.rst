**Illustration 36: The Date Selector Library at Work in the Frontend**

The Date Selector Library adds a mini-calendar selection option for Frontend users when creating a new date (see Illustration 36). To add this extension, simply install it like any typical extension. The Date Selector button will automatically appear in the Frontend when creating or editing dates.
