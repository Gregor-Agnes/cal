The Other Tab offers three miscellaneous options .

**Illustration 26: Calendar Event: Other Tab**

Refer to Illustration 26.
- **Fe-users to be notified...:** If Frontend users have subscribed to
  events, their usernames will appear here. In addition, if you wish to
  subscribe particular users to the event, you can manually select them
  from existing users in the General Storage Folder.

- **Exception events:** Exception Events are generally used in
  conjunction with Recurring Events. Exception Events are days on which
  you don't want a recurring event scheduled. For instance, skipping the
  Quilting Group's event on Christmas day. If you have created Exception
  Event records or Exception Event Groups, you can select those here.

- **Share this event with another user:** If you have allowed Groups of
  Registered Frontend users to edit events (see the :ref:`TypoScriptReferenceSetup`
  section), you can allow individual registered users from other groups
  to edit this event if you desire by adding their Website user name
  here.
  |img-4| **Note**: Frontend editing (in the :ref:`ConstantEditor`) must be enabled
  for this option to function.
